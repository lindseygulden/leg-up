The 80% by 2030 requirement is discussed on pages 117-118 of Jacobson, M.Z., M.A. Delucchi, Z.A.F. Bauer, S.C. Goodman, W.E. Chapman, M.A. Cameron, Alphabetical: C. Bozonnat, L. Chobadi, H.A.

In addition, the IMF scenarios used to estimate the 50-70% number are based on the wrong assumptions that CCS and nuclear and DAC will help when this is incredibly improbable (with respect to CCS and DAC, please see Jacobson, M.Z., The health and climate impacts of carbon capture and direct air capture, Energy and Environmental Sciences, 12, 3567-3574, doi:10.1039/C9EE02709B, 2019; with respect to nuclear, please see https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/NuclearVsWWS.pdf). Because new CCS, DAC, and nuclear will be no help at all prior to 2030 (due to the CO2 benefit of CCS and 10-19-year time-lag between planning and operation for nuclear), it will be necessary for more renewables to fulfil the gap (thus at least 80% by 2030) to avoid 1.5 C warming.',\n",

As such, scenarios built around CCS/DAC give the false impression that a solution is available when in fact it is not. This is a significant issue, because countries will depend on IPCC's incorrect claim that CCS/DAC are legitimate mitigation options when they are opportunity costs that increase emissions in comparison with spending the same money on direct mitigation.

Suggest that this topic be assessed in the context of recent trends in Ch2, near term and long term in Ch3-4 and energy in Ch6 perhaps through a cross chapter effort. The findings of assessment of this topic should inform the description of future climate change and potential impacts in the other volumes of the AR6 and it is therefore important that this be carried out soon so that their assessments will be informed by the status of RCP8.5.

      "Debra Roberts, South Africa: It would be useful to have early in the SPM a ‘shopping list’ of current mitigation options, briefly explained, with a measure of their mitigation potential, with a brief overview of (co-)benefits and trade-offs. Perhaps in the form of a box. e.g. the SPM talks about carbon capture and storage, but for anyone new to the field (remembering that policy makers come and go constantly) no assumptions should be made about readers’ level of background knowledge. The SPM needs to stand on its own – in time as well as in content.\n",

We urge the authors to present a more balanced assessment of these issues and provide an overview of the potentials and risks as well as uncertainties. An assessment of the IPCC should not only refer to findings from natural sciences and technology, but also address the environmental and socioeconomic context of the technologies presented. The SRCCL clearly highlighted the problematic issue of BECCS in high overshoot scenarios and in pathways where large deployment is needed. This analysis is nearly completely absent from the current version of the SPM.\n",

      "Karl Hausker, United States of America: In my view, a fundamental but easily correctable general problem with the draft SPM is that it does not portray key characteristics of its eleven IPs that are IMPORTANT to policymakers. What is missing is best shown by contrasting it with the portrayals in the Special Report on 1.5 degrees:\n",
      "The SR.15 SPM does a far better job at portraying its Illustrative Pathways (IPs) --  in section C. The key means of doing this is Figure SPM.3b (p.14). This figure graphically displays the four IPs in terms of emissions over time, and the three key components: fossil fuel & industry, AFOLU, and BECCS. Furthermore, the table that is part of the figure gives valuable details on the IPs including: final energy demand; renewable share in electricity generation, and the percentage change in primary energy supply (over 2010) for key sources -- coal, oil, gas, nuclear, biomass, non-biomass renewables; cumulative CCS by 2100 (total and BECCS only); and some land, CH4, and N2O indicators. The accompanying text in Section C provides further details on the IPs, and most importantly, the roles that different technologies play. \n",
      "The draft AR6 SPM does not contain the richness of the depiction of IPs that appears in the SR1.5 SPM (nor even the lower level of detail of the AR5 SPM). The key section (again Section C) immediately presents a table of “key characteristics” of pathways, but it does so just in terms of emissions and temperatures mapped to C1-C7 scenarios, not to the eleven IPs. Sec. C3 begins to lay out the eleven IPs but not in a structured, comprehensive way. Figure SPM.7a presents the emission trajectories of the eleven IPs. 7b needs more explanation. 7c and 7d address timing questions. Section C4 talks about the potential for demand-side mitigation. Then Section C5 addresses the energy system transformations. But the text just talks about “low-carbon energy forms”, “low-carbon energy carriers”, and energy efficiency. It notes the cost declines in renewables and batteries; it notes that “low-carbon technologies will need to supply 90% or 100% of global electricity by 2050…”; and it notes the risks of stranded investments. Additional sections address transport, buildings, industry, AFOLU, CDR, and overall costs. Most of the discussion is very qualitative. What is missing is more quantitative depictions of the eleven IPs and the mix of technologies needed for these to preserve a safe climate. \n",
      "Text, data, and figures could be pulled from Chapter 3.  Figure 3.6 is analogous to the figure I just described: Fig. SPM.3b from SR1.5 SPM. Figure 3.6 gives a rich portrayal of how the mitigation strategies in the IPs take us from over 40 Gt now to net zero and then negative global emissions. The figure depicts the roles of CO2 and nonCO2 emissions, fossil w/ CCS, industry, BECCS, and other CDR (renewables and nuclear not depicted, of course, due to zero emissions).\n",
      "An improved SPM should also draw from figures and underlying data of Chapter 6’s Box 6.9: primary energy, secondary energy carriers, and final energy (per capita and GDP).  Data should be aggregated to the global level depicting EJ/year from various sources: biomass, fossil with CCS, fossil without CCS, non-biomass renewables, and nuclear.  Regional breakdowns can also provide insights (as currently in Box 6.9) but the global aggregates are more important and point to priorities for advancing low- and zero-carbon technologies into full commercialization. These depictions belong in the AR6 SPM. They provide policymakers a concrete feel for the diverse primary energy sources and secondary energy carriers needed for a decarbonized economy.     \n",
      "“FOOTNOTE”: AR5 SPM is also superior to the current draft on these points. In AR5 WG3 SPM, section 4.2 presents “Sectoral and cross-sectoral mitigation pathways and measures.” This section has text and figures that depict important details of the scenarios reviewed.\n",
      "Fig. SPM.7 (p.18) depicts “Direct Sectoral CO2 and Non-CO2 GHG Emissions in Baseline and [two] Mitigation Scenarios with and without CCS.” It vividly conveys what the studies reviewed implied about the role CCS could play in achieving concentrations of ~450ppm, and the huge role AFOLU would have to play if CCS were not available.  \n",
      "In its text, Section 4.2.2 on Energy Supply has paragraphs with important details dedicated to: renewables, nuclear, gas substitution for coal, fossil with CCS, and bioenergy with CCS. \n",
      "Figure SPM.9 (p.27) presents “Change in annual investment flows” related to electricity generations for scenarios that could stabilize concentrations at 430-530ppm by 2100. The figure gives breakdowns by key categories: renewables, nuclear, plants with and without CCS, etc.\n",

      "Cédric PHILIBERT, France: The \"falling cost of low carbon technologies\" is an oversimplification. Despite the need for brievity here, one should read \"the falling costs of some key low carbon technologies, notably solar and wind power, and batteries\". Nuclear has seen its costs keep growing, the costs of CCS haven't changed significantly, etc. This is explicited on p. 22, l.1 to l.4 but would need to be brought up asap in the SPM.\n",

      "Genevieve Guenther, United States of America: This sentence raises a number of questions. It lacks an assessment of the likelihood of halting warming at 1.5°C under this mitigation timeline. It offers a later timeline for net zero than SR 1.5 without explaining the revised timeline. And it doesn't say whether this timeline to net zero includes CDR later this century. I wonder about this omission, given that Section C10 says that CDR \"is an element in most scenarios that limit warming to 1.5-2°C by 2100\" (page SPM-25, lines 16-17; see also SMP-15, lines 19-22 and SPM-17, section C2). It is imperative that policymakers be presented with the implications of stated carbon budgets and the concept of \"overshoot\" in the topline of the summary; that the majority of model pathways to 1.5°C include planetary-scale negative GHG emissions is arguably not well understood either by policymakers or the general public. Further all references to the role of CDR in model pathways need to acknowledge CDR's real-world feasibility issues in order for the implications of carbon budgets to be clear. These feasibility issues are highlighted in Chapter 12, pg 23, lines 23-25 (\"The volumes of CDR deployment assumed in IMA-based global emissions mitigation scenarios are significant if compared to current volumes of deployment, given that the feasibility of rapid and sustained upscaling is uncertain\"). Other feasibility concerns appear in the SPM itself. See page 25, line 31 (\"The potential for DACCS is limited primarily by access to low carbon energy and cost\") and page 30 lines 35-36 (\"At very high deployment, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) could lead to adverse side effects (medium confidence)\". Governments and other stakeholders cannot make informed decisions about mitigation actions without having all the assumptions and mechanisms of pathways, and the limits of carbon budgets, presented explicitly and clearly.\n",

      "Hans Poertner, Germany: I like the clarity of the figure, but was wondering if the picture of lesser tools in lower pathways is not misleading. Wouldn't lower pathways mean that some options couldn't be neglected anymore like BECCS, some forms of SRM etc. So one would have less options but would be forced to use more \"tools\"? Maybe it's also not so clear what is meant by tools? Technologies? Policies? I was also thinking if the order is correct: wouldn't the use of a broarder set of tools bring societies to the upper pathways and not vice versa?\n",

      "Helmut Haberl, Austria: This claim is not well visible in Figure SPM.3, it seems the error bar in the left part of part b just reaches to -4%, so one might suspect that this is perhaps only one country? As it is indeed an important finding (although in my view would require to be formulated more cautiously), perhaps the Fig should be revised in order to show this more clearly? Also I think that there is a big caveat, which is that this will not happen by itself, as a continuation of past efforts; rather it requires deployment of strong and effective policies, as was also shown by the study of Le Quere which probably underlies this message. There are also very good reasons to be skeptical about CCS, not least the increased energy requirements of C capture from flue gases, and the risks of the storages, and I think CCS should be seen as measure of last resort; reductions in demand (ch5!) and sustainable renewables should have priority.\n",

      "Government of Germany, Germany: Please delete this sentence and replace by figures and statements consistent with those of the previous sentence on solar, wind and batteries (rate of decreasing costs and share in energy supply). If cost decrease for bioenergy applications cannot be quantified, please add an information on this knowledge gap and the involved complexity. Rationale: It's not clear why a vague hint on net-mitigation through the AFOLU sector is to be given in this paragraph in an attempt to underline overall importance of bioenergy deployment. Not only against the background of existing risks for increased emissions through bioenergy applications while depleting carbon sinks, it seems suggestive and not appropriate to do so. REFERENCES: Brack,D., 2017, Woody Biomass for Power and Heat-Impacts on the Global Climate; Brack, D. and King, R., 2020, Net Zero and Beyond-What Role for Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage?; EASAC (2018), Statement on carbon neutrality ). Moreover, the figure seems to be taken from Ch 7, 7.2.2.4, but we cannot find a source. When combining the anthropogenic AFOLU net source with the non-AFOLU net sink, the total net land-atmosphere flux was -7.0 ± 4.0 GtCO2 (net sink) during 2009-2018, (high confidence in net sink, medium confidence in magnitude) (Friedlingstein et al. under review)[...]) and doesn't seem to be quoted correctly in the SPM. In this regard, it also should be critically discussed if combining anthropogenic AFOLU net source with the (remaining) non-AFOLU net sink is justified in order to promote net-advantages of bioenergy.\n",

      "Gabrielle Dreyfus, United States of America: The estimated mitigation potential of BECCS and bioenergy should take into account that bioenergy, especially harvesting forest biomass for energy, is not carbon neutral in the near-term—with a carbon deficit for many years, generally several decades to a century—that is crucial for mitigating emissions and avoiding hitting the 1.5°C mark. Danielle Venton, Core Concept: Can bioenergy with carbon capture and storage make an impact?, PNAS (2016); Leturcq, P. (2020) GHG Displacement Factors of Harvested Wood Products: the Myth of Substitution, NATURE SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 10:1–9; Sterman J. D., et al. (2018) Does replacing coal with wood lower CO2 emissions? Dynamic lifecycle analysis of wood bioenergy, ENVTL. RESEARCH LETTERS 13(015007):1–10, 1 (“We simulate substitution of wood for coal in power generation, estimating the parameters governing NPP and other fluxes using data for forests in the eastern US and using published estimates for supply chain emissions. Because combustion and processing efficiencies for wood are less than coal, the immediate impact of substituting wood for coal is an increase in atmospheric CO2 relative to coal. The payback time for this carbon debt ranges from 44–104 years after clear-cut, depending on forest type—assuming the land remains forest. Surprisingly, replanting hardwood forests with fast-growing pine plantations raises the CO2 impact of wood because the equilibrium carbon density of plantations is lower than natural forests. Further, projected growth in wood harvest for bioenergy would increase atmospheric CO2 for at least a century because new carbon debt continuously exceeds NPP. Assuming biofuels are carbon neutral may worsen irreversible impacts of climate change before benefits accrue. Instead, explicit dynamic models should be used to assess the climate impacts of biofuels.”).\n",
      "Even when the bioenergy comes from burning forest residue, research shows that bioenergy is not carbon neutral within 10 years and often not carbon neutral for much longer. Repo, A., et al. (2012) Forest bioenergy climate impact can be improved by allocating forest residue removal, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY, 4:202-212, 209 (“The results of this study show that using forest residues for energy production is neither GHG emission free nor carbon neutral. This is mainly because the combustion of forest residues releases the carbon into the atmosphere much faster than natural decomposition of the residues. Hence, the energy use of forest residues decreases the carbon stocks of the forests and increases the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs compared to situation in which harvest residues are not used for energy (e.g. Palosuo et al., 2001; Holmgren et al., 2007; Kujanpa ̈a ̈ et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2010; Zanchi et al., 2010).”); Booth, M.

      "Furthermore, even if BECCS were net zero or negative in the relevant next couple of decades, which it is not, large-scale biodiversity development requires vast land-use changes, which may have significant implications for food security and biodiversity. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research Agenda,10 (2019) (“Because food demand is expected to double by mid-century, repurposing a significant amount of current agricultural land to produce feedstocks for BECCS or for afforestation/reforestation might have a significant effect on food availability and food prices, with far-reaching effects on national security and biodiversity.”). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land warns that high implementation of BECCS (11.3 GtCO2 yr-1 in 2050) could increase the population at risk of hunger by up to 150 million people and could have significant impacts on desertification and land degradation. IPCC, Summary for Policymakers, In: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC Special Report on Climate Change, Desertification, Land Degradation, Sustainable Land Management, Food Security, and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems, 27 (2019) (“Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts, assuming carbon dioxide removal by BECCS at a scale of 11.3 GtCO2 yr-1 in 2050, and noting that bioenergy without CCS can also achieve emissions reductions of up to several GtCO2 yr-1 when it is a low carbon energy source {2.6.1; 6.3.1}. Studies linking bioenergy to food security estimate an increase in the population at risk of hunger to up to 150 million people at this level of implementation {6.3.5}. The red hatched cells for desertification and land degradation indicate that while up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100 in 2°C scenarios which will increase pressure for desertification and land degradation, the actual area affected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified {6.3.3; 6.3.4}.”). Using BECCS to draw down between 2 and 10 Gt CO2 annually would require the dedication of land equivalent to the size of India, and possibly even double this amount, to support biomass production, introducing daunting logistical issues. Anderson K. & Peters G., The Trouble with Negative Emissions, Science 354:182–183 (2016)  (“Moreover, the scale of biomass assumed in IAMs—typically, one to two times the area of India—raises profound questions about carbon neutrality, land availability, competition with food production, and competing demands for bioenergy from the transport, heating, and industrial sectors. The logistics of collating and transporting vast quantities of bioenergy—equivalent to up to half of the total global primary energy consumption—is seldom addressed. Some studies suggest that BECCS pathways are feasible, at least locally, but globally there are substantial limitations. BECCS thus remains a highly speculative technology.”). BECCS also faces infrastructure-based limits from the lack of suitable long-distance biomass and CO2 transport. Baik E. et al., Geospatial Analysis of Near-term Potential for Carbon-negative Bioenergy in the United States, Proc. Nat’l. Acad. Sci. 115(13):3290–3295 (2018) (“Previous BECCS deployment assessments have largely overlooked the potential lack of spatial colocation of suitable storage basins and biomass availability, in the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport. These conditions could constrain the near-term technical deployment potential of BECCS due to social and economic barriers that exist for biomass and CO2 transport…If the total biomass resource available in the United States was mobilized for BECCS, an estimated 370 Mt CO2⋅y−1 of negative emissions could be supplied in 2020. However, the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport, as well as limitations imposed by unsuitable regional storage and injection capacities, collectively decrease the technical potential of negative emissions to 100 Mt CO2⋅y−1.”). Moreover, large-scale BECCS could put significant strains on global freshwater use, biosphere integrity, and biogeochemical flows. Heck V. et al., Biomass-based Negative Emissions Difficult to Reconcile with Planetary Boundaries, Nature Climate Change 8:151–155 (2018) (“[W]hile large-scale BECCS is intended to lower the pressure on the [planetary boundaries (PB)] for climate change, it would most likely steer the Earth system closer to the PB for freshwater use and lead to further transgression of the PBs for land-system change, biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows.”). \n",
      "Because of its many adverse consequences, bioenergy raises environmental justice issues. Wood pellet production facilities are often located in communities of color and environmental justice communities. Purifoy D., How Europe’s Wood Pellet Appetite Worsens Environmental Racism in the South (5 October 2020) (“From Northampton County to Alabama’s Black Belt, residents and activists say companies such as Enviva exploit mostly communities of color with promises to build up busted local economies with a \"green energy\" industry. Instead, communities hosting wood pellet facilities are not only further burdened by pollution and other local dangers, they are also entangled in yet another climate damaging trend — the destruction of biodiverse hardwood forests and the rise of monoculture tree plantations to produce energy that appears to pose climate threats similar to coal.”). The production process releases harmful pollutants into the air and increases noise pollution, while the harvesting decreases biodiversity in the surrounding areas. Danielle Purifoy, How Europe’s Wood Pellet Appetite Worsens Environmental Racism in the South (5 October 2020) (“Northampton County residents such as Joyner are more immediately concerned about the acute impacts of wood pellet manufacturing, from local clear cutting of privately owned forests to the 24/7 production process. […] In addition to the noise from grinding trees and truck traffic, Alston and others complain about a constant cloud of dust flowing from the plant onto their homes, cars, gardens and into their lungs. ”); Environmental Integrity Project (26 April 2018), Dirty Deception: How the Wood Biomass Industry Skirts the Clean Air Act, 4-5 (“[Environmental Integrity Project’s] survey reveals that these facilities emit dangerous amounts of air pollution, and further finds that state agencies consistently fall well short of their duty to ensure that these facilities control their pollution to the levels required by law, frequently due to misleading information supplied by the industry. As a result, many large pellet mills have been allowed to emit air pollution, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants at levels well above legal limits for years at a time.”). These harms occur while the industry is falling short of its proposed climate and job goals. Note the environmental movement backlash against BECCS. See Anderson K. & Peters G.

      "Durwood Zaelke, United States of America: The estimated mitigation potential of BECCS and bioenergy should take into account that bioenergy, especially harvesting forest biomass for energy, is not carbon neutral in the near-term—with a carbon deficit for many years, generally several decades to a century—that is crucial for mitigating emissions and avoiding hitting the 1.5°C mark. Danielle Venton, Core Concept: Can bioenergy with carbon capture and storage make an impact?, PNAS (2016); Leturcq, P. (2020) GHG Displacement Factors of Harvested Wood Products: the Myth of Substitution, NATURE SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 10:1–9; Sterman J. D., et al. (2018) Does replacing coal with wood lower CO2 emissions? Dynamic lifecycle analysis of wood bioenergy, ENVTL. RESEARCH LETTERS 13(015007):1–10, 1 (“We simulate substitution of wood for coal in power generation, estimating the parameters governing NPP and other fluxes using data for forests in the eastern US and using published estimates for supply chain emissions. Because combustion and processing efficiencies for wood are less than coal, the immediate impact of substituting wood for coal is an increase in atmospheric CO2 relative to coal. The payback time for this carbon debt ranges from 44–104 years after clear-cut, depending on forest type—assuming the land remains forest. Surprisingly, replanting hardwood forests with fast-growing pine plantations raises the CO2 impact of wood because the equilibrium carbon density of plantations is lower than natural forests. Further, projected growth in wood harvest for bioenergy would increase atmospheric CO2 for at least a century because new carbon debt continuously exceeds NPP. Assuming biofuels are carbon neutral may worsen irreversible impacts of climate change before benefits accrue. Instead, explicit dynamic models should be used to assess the climate impacts of biofuels.”).\n",
      "Even when the bioenergy comes from burning forest residue, research shows that bioenergy is not carbon neutral within 10 years and often not carbon neutral for much longer. Repo, A., et al. (2012) Forest bioenergy climate impact can be improved by allocating forest residue removal, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY, 4:202-212, 209 (“The results of this study show that using forest residues for energy production is neither GHG emission free nor carbon neutral. This is mainly because the combustion of forest residues releases the carbon into the atmosphere much faster than natural decomposition of the residues. Hence, the energy use of forest residues decreases the carbon stocks of the forests and increases the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs compared to situation in which harvest residues are not used for energy (e.g. Palosuo et al., 2001; Holmgren et al., 2007; Kujanpa ̈a ̈ et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2010; Zanchi et al., 2010).”); Booth, M.

      "Furthermore, even if BECCS were net zero or negative in the relevant next couple of decades, which it is not, large-scale biodiversity development requires vast land-use changes, which may have significant implications for food security and biodiversity. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research Agenda,10 (2019) (“Because food demand is expected to double by mid-century, repurposing a significant amount of current agricultural land to produce feedstocks for BECCS or for afforestation/reforestation might have a significant effect on food availability and food prices, with far-reaching effects on national security and biodiversity.”). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land warns that high implementation of BECCS (11.3 GtCO2 yr-1 in 2050) could increase the population at risk of hunger by up to 150 million people and could have significant impacts on desertification and land degradation. IPCC, Summary for Policymakers, In: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC Special Report on Climate Change, Desertification, Land Degradation, Sustainable Land Management, Food Security, and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems, 27 (2019) (“Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts, assuming carbon dioxide removal by BECCS at a scale of 11.3 GtCO2 yr-1 in 2050, and noting that bioenergy without CCS can also achieve emissions reductions of up to several GtCO2 yr-1 when it is a low carbon energy source {2.6.1; 6.3.1}. Studies linking bioenergy to food security estimate an increase in the population at risk of hunger to up to 150 million people at this level of implementation {6.3.5}. The red hatched cells for desertification and land degradation indicate that while up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100 in 2°C scenarios which will increase pressure for desertification and land degradation, the actual area affected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified {6.3.3; 6.3.4}.”). Using BECCS to draw down between 2 and 10 Gt CO2 annually would require the dedication of land equivalent to the size of India, and possibly even double this amount, to support biomass production, introducing daunting logistical issues. Anderson K. & Peters G., The Trouble with Negative Emissions, Science 354:182–183 (2016)  (“Moreover, the scale of biomass assumed in IAMs—typically, one to two times the area of India—raises profound questions about carbon neutrality, land availability, competition with food production, and competing demands for bioenergy from the transport, heating, and industrial sectors. The logistics of collating and transporting vast quantities of bioenergy—equivalent to up to half of the total global primary energy consumption—is seldom addressed. Some studies suggest that BECCS pathways are feasible, at least locally, but globally there are substantial limitations. BECCS thus remains a highly speculative technology.”). BECCS also faces infrastructure-based limits from the lack of suitable long-distance biomass and CO2 transport. Baik E. et al., Geospatial Analysis of Near-term Potential for Carbon-negative Bioenergy in the United States, Proc. Nat’l. Acad. Sci. 115(13):3290–3295 (2018) (“Previous BECCS deployment assessments have largely overlooked the potential lack of spatial colocation of suitable storage basins and biomass availability, in the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport. These conditions could constrain the near-term technical deployment potential of BECCS due to social and economic barriers that exist for biomass and CO2 transport…If the total biomass resource available in the United States was mobilized for BECCS, an estimated 370 Mt CO2⋅y−1 of negative emissions could be supplied in 2020. However, the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport, as well as limitations imposed by unsuitable regional storage and injection capacities, collectively decrease the technical potential of negative emissions to 100 Mt CO2⋅y−1.”). Moreover, large-scale BECCS could put significant strains on global freshwater use, biosphere integrity, and biogeochemical flows. Heck V. et al., Biomass-based Negative Emissions Difficult to Reconcile with Planetary Boundaries, Nature Climate Change 8:151–155 (2018) (“[W]hile large-scale BECCS is intended to lower the pressure on the [planetary boundaries (PB)] for climate change, it would most likely steer the Earth system closer to the PB for freshwater use and lead to further transgression of the PBs for land-system change, biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows.”). \n",
      "Because of its many adverse consequences, bioenergy raises environmental justice issues. Wood pellet production facilities are often located in communities of color and environmental justice communities. Purifoy D., How Europe’s Wood Pellet Appetite Worsens Environmental Racism in the South (5 October 2020) (“From Northampton County to Alabama’s Black Belt, residents and activists say companies such as Enviva exploit mostly communities of color with promises to build up busted local economies with a \"green energy\" industry.

The production process releases harmful pollutants into the air and increases noise pollution, while the harvesting decreases biodiversity in the surrounding areas. Danielle Purifoy, How Europe’s Wood Pellet Appetite Worsens Environmental Racism in the South (5 October 2020) (“Northampton County residents such as Joyner are more immediately concerned about the acute impacts of wood pellet manufacturing, from local clear cutting of privately owned forests to the 24/7 production process.

The statement regarding BECCS not being ready as a technology and in need of further R&D is misleading (line 29-30). Please consider describing BECCS separately from the other technologies listed here, since they are in a much earlier stage of development. Carbon capture on biogenic flue gases from a range of different point sources are ready to be deployed, but are held back by lack of incentives and institutional barriers. Adding BECCS on waste to energy, production of biofuels, bioethanol and biogas, and on some industries utilising biogenic material could be a good starting point on CDR. These CO2 emissions are often well suited for CCS (high CO2 concentration in flue gas). CCS on the production of bioethanol for example, is mentioned in chapter 11.3.6, page 11-35, line 26, as commercially available and cheap (USD10-40). Another source could be Sanchez, Johnsen et. al., 2018: \"Near-term deployment of carbon capture and sequestration from biorefineries in the United States.\", DOI 10.1073/pnas.1719695115. Since emissions of bio-CO2 is considered carbon neutral, many point sources of bio-CO2 are neither reported in national statistics nor considered in climate policy frameworks. For example, it might not be even be possible to report emission reductions from BECCS to the UNFCCC with the current Common Reporting Format, CRF, and bio-CO2 is excluded from carbon pricing schemes such as EU-ETS.

      "Reason: The current wording  is counter-intuitive (wrong?). How can greater use of land-based resources involve less trade-offs with sustainable development than others? Using land-based resources will put pressure on sustainable development indicators. At least it is a confusing statement especially in context of a possible choice between afforestation and BECCS for CDR (whereby the former has the same risks of being done un-sustainably as the latter, yet additionally more and more land needs to be afforested to achieve ongoing removal (compared to BECCS).\n",

      "Government of Netherlands, Netherlands: Bioenergy and BECCS' (in section AFOLU) is considered as being mainly negative with respect to SDG2 (Zero Hunger) However, statement D3.2 correctly states that \"In the AFOLU sector, agroforestry, avoided deforestation and reforestation can provide land carbon torage and biomass for multiple uses, while enhancing biodiversity and essential ecosystem services.\". Statement D3.3 indicated that bioenergy could lead to adverse side-effect if \"deployed poorly\". And als also in statement D4.4 it is indicated that bioenergy can have mixed impacts. Therefore it is strongly suggested to change this red box (i.e. being negative) into a light blue boxes (i.e. both synergies and trade-offs can be expected), following the statements that cover the issue of bioenergy.\n",

      "Government of Saint Lucia, Saint Lucia: This comprehensive analysis on SDGs is very useful given the need to embed climate action in a SDG context. However, the level of detail might be a bit over the top and some categories difficult to understand. E.g. how is geothermal and energy storage bad for life on land? Is it really, and always and e.g. as bad as other negative categories (the authors may not intend to send that message, but this is what the figure is effectively conveying). Also, how are impacts different for bioenergy and bioenergy and CCS? Is it really the CCS part that e.g. contributes to negative impacts on zero hunger, or something else? It seems some double-checking and also expert assessment of the compiled evidence might be warranted. Furthermore, it is sometimes difficult to interpret these findings without a counterfactual and the actions are not all mutually exclusive. If i.e. a fossil fuel phase out is achieved, other energy sources need to come in. The net effect on SDGs is what counts. So on a more general level, we think it would be worth a reflection whether or not such a figure is indeed most helpful for the SPM. Or whether a version linked to (a reduced) set of illustrative pathways could be useful. The SDGs effects of actions under those pathways could be illustrated given policy makers an idea, what policy package illustrated by these pathways would maximise SDG co-benefits and minimise trade offs.\n",

      "Carl Schleusner, Germany: This is an impressive assessment. However, I am not sure I find all of the entries plausible (e.g. for storage and SDG 15 and efficient applicances and SDG9 and the inconsistencies between bioenergy and BECCS). But more importantly, the analysis, as useful as it is, is not really able to inform policy. Because policy makers always need to go for portfolios of options, encapsulated in scenarios, and some of them have more SDG synergies than others. I'd thus recommend to replace this figure with a figure illustrating SDG effects for different IPs. It should also focus on the very near-term. The SDGs are to be achieved by 2030. Whether or not they will is questionable. But doing a 2100 analysis on SDGs also feels a bit off…\n",

      "Erik Haites, Canada: Section E of the SPM should help policy makers strengthen mitigation action. The current text, to be polite, is irrelevant and totally useless for that purpose. This is especially disappointing since there is a lot of useful material that could be presented. Specifically, policy makers could use information on how to enhance national policies and how to enhance international cooperation to strengthen mitigation action. With respect to national policies we know global mitigation action is still inadequate, a substantial share of global emissions still is not targeted by mitigation policies, those categories of emissions include industrial process emissions and many non-CO2 gases and CCUS, addressing those emissions may need innovative policies, etc. With respect to international cooperation the finance and technology chapters include information on ways to enhance support for action by developing countries. Virtually all of this information is missing from the current draft of section E.\n",

      "Cédric PHILIBERT, France: A very important statement about industry should be underlined at the outset of the SPM, and its significance broaden to the entire economy: \"Some scenarios achieve close to net zero emissions from the most energy intensive industries  (steel, chemicals, and cement) by 2050. Reduced materials demand, more recycling, and electrification  can lower mitigation costs and the need for CCS, but these options are not well represented in published  scenarios. A number of concepts have emerged in the last few years, largely based on the acknowledgement that solar PV and wind power are now offering a huge potential of cheap bulk electricity. They have been identified in some papers and reports as well as by stakeholders, but are not well represented in the whole body of literature assessed nor in the \"illustrative pathways\". This is the price of the rigorous IPCC assessment procedures, that ends up in basing reports on a large body of literature that may be rapidly outdated given the speed of the improvements that have been seen in the last ten years with respect to solar PV (basically a division by ten), batteries (almost the same) and wind power, on and off shore. This should be mitigated with well placed, visible and expllicit caveats. In my view, the Technical Summary does paradoxicallyh a better job than the SPM in bringing the important information up-front to the readers' attention.\n",
