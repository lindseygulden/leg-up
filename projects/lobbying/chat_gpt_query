Use both the string names themselves and information you get from internet sources to classify organization names into each of the above categories, please. For the two categories dealing with hydrogen, if they are focused on hydrogen NOT made with methane gas, add them to green hydrogen; if they use methane to make hydrogen, or if they tout 'clean hydrogen' or 'blue hydrogen', assign them to the  'clean hydrogen' category.  You must assign each company to one of the categories, and every category must have at least one member. 

Return results as python dictionary in which the dictionary key values are the names of the industries (strings) and the dictionary's values are python lists, in which the members of each list are the organization names, expressed as python strings. 

Here are some tricky ones and the right answers: EXXON is oil and gas. So are TOTAL and SHELL. MILESTONE ENVIRONMENTAL is oilfield services. Black Veatch, WSP, and Schneider Electric all should be part of the engineering consulting category. Revisit the classification already completed with this new category in mind. DRUMMOND is a coal business. OHIO MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC ASSOCIATION is power generation and utilities. ALUMINUM ASSOCIATION is mining. MM Energy is oilfield services
