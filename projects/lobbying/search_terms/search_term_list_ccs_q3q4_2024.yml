# Supplemental query file to capture bills and terms that were filed in the second half of 2024
# written 2/2025

# Bill names or some referred to only by their bill number (HR XXX or S XXX)
# Because the same bill numbers recur throughout different Congresses, I went through and removed the key terms

# comment these out (they are optional: if not specified, the lda_query.py script will query all available years.
