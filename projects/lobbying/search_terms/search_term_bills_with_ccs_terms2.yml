#  --- 2 of 2 files with ccs-provision-containing bill/law and ccs term queries ---
# other file is search_term_bills_with_ccs_terms1.yml

# This file contains terms link bills or laws with significant CCS provisions to
# terms that frequently indicate ccs ('clean' and 'hydrogen', 'section 45', etc.)

# This is probably not exhaustive. I didn't include "hydrogen","natural gas" or "hydrogen","methane"
# because those two terms together pretty much indicate clean hydrogen (and, as such, CCS)

# search terms for use in the lda querying interface. Note that all terms below will be joined with an 'OR'
