# List of organizations to query for full picture of steel-industry lobbying. Company names
# were gleaned from other LDA disclosures and from a web search to find major players in the steel
# industry.
# because the LDA API doesn't handle advanced text searching for client_name, these are
# handed to the API sequentially, one at a time.
# prefixes for api-query-result .csv files to be written by lda_query.py
