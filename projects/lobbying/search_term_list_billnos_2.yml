#  --- 2 of 3 files with bill-number queries ---
# other files are called 'search_term_list_billnos_1.yml' and 'search_term_list_billnos_3.yml'

# This file contains terms that find potential lobbying activities that are CCS specific, 
# referred to only by their bill number (HR XXX or S XXX)

# N.B. I tried out all of these queries in the web-based LDA search: if something is commented out, it either
# returned no results OR it returned no results for the right congressional years (e.g., nothing for the 117th congress) 
# OR it returned only results with terms that would already be identified as 'definite' CCS (e.g., 
# "carbon capture and storage" is in the description)
#
# search terms for use in the lda querying interface. Note that all terms below will be joined with an 'OR'
